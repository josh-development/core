### Josh Concept Guidelines

There are a number of guidelines considered when reviewing Pull Requests to be merged. _This is by no means an exhaustive list, but here are some things to consider before/while submitting your ideas._

- Everything in Josh should be generally useful for the majority of users. Don't let that stop you if you've got a good concept though, as your idea still might be a great addition.
- Everything should follow [OOP paradigms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) and generally rely on behavior over state where possible. This abstraction, and leads to efficiency and therefore scalability.
- Everything should follow our ESLint rules as closely as possible, and should pass lint tests even if you must disable a rule for a single line.
- Scripts that are to be ran outside of the scope source files should be added to [scripts](/scripts) directory and should be in the `mjs` file format.
